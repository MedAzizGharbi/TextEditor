This is what i learned so far making this text editor:
The canonic input in C
How to implement a raw mode where we read input byte by byte and not line by line
	For that we used the library <termios.h>
Also learned about control characters which are characters that can't be printed
	- ASCII from 0 to 31 and 127 (This includes TAB , DEL , ESC ...)
Learned about keymapping


The last thing i reached is " Clear the screen on exit "
